Hi!

Code receives and processes that , distance to destination, monsters' (Bug,Zombie,ZombieDog,Lion,Mutant) and hero's
health points (healthPoint / hp) and attack points (attackPoint).  
It takes this information from the "SimulationText.txt" file.


In each encounter of Hero and Monsters along this path, their health points decrease as much as the enemy's attack points,
After each encounter, the Hero's remaining health points are recorded in the "Simulationlog.txt" file.

If the Hero's health is reset or below zero before reaching the destination, the hero dies and the simulation ends.

Note: If you change the text format, numbers and keywords (eg: Lion, hero, mutant, zombie, zombieDog, resources, health point, hp etc) 
in the file, the code will get an error.
